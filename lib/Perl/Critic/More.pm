=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::More - Supplemental policies for Perl::Critic

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -MCPAN -e'install Perl::Critic::More'
  perlcritic -theme more lib/Foo.pm

=head1 AFFILIATION

This file has no functionality, but instead is a placeholder for a loose
collection of Perl::Critic policies.  All of those policies will have an
"Affiliation" section announcing their participation in this grouping.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of L<Perl::Critic> policies that are not included in
the Perl::Critic core for a variety of reasons:

=over

=item * Experimental

Some policies need some time to work out their kinks, test usability, or gauge
community interest.  A subset of these will end up in the core Perl::Critic
someday.

=item * Requires special dependencies

For example, some policies require development versions of PPI (or some other
CPAN module).  These will likely end up in the Perl::Critic core when their
dependencies are fulfilled.

=item * Peripheral to Perl

For example, the C<Editor::RequireEmacsFileVariables> policy is metacode.
These are not part of Perl::Critic's mission.

=item * Special purpose

For example, policies like C<CodeLayout::RequireASCII> designed to scratch
itches not felt by most of the community.  These will always remain in a
Perl::Critic supplement instead of in the core.

=back

All of these policies have the theme C<more> so they can be turned off as a
group via F<.perlcriticrc> by adding this line:

  theme = not more

The special purpose ones may be part of the C<notrecommended> theme.  Avoid
these via:

  theme = not notrecommended

Sorry about the double-negative...  See L<Perl::Critic/"CONFIGURATION"> for
details on how to interact with themes.
