NAME
    Perl::Critic::More - Supplemental policies for Perl::Critic

SYNOPSIS
      perl -MCPAN -e'install Perl::Critic::More'
      perlcritic -theme more lib/Foo.pm

DESCRIPTION
    This is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that are not included in
    the Perl::Critic core for a variety of reasons:

    * Peripheral to Perl
        For example, the `Editor::RequireEmacsFileVariables' policy is
        metacode.

    * Requires special CPAN modules
        For example, some policies require development versions of PPI.

    * Special purpose
        For example, policies designed to scratch itches not felt by most of
        the community.

    All of these policies have the theme `more' so they can be turned off as
    a group via .perlcriticrc by adding this line:

      theme = not more
