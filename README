NAME
    Perl::Critic::More - Supplemental policies for Perl::Critic

SYNOPSIS
      perl -MCPAN -e'install Perl::Critic::More'
      perlcritic -theme more lib/Foo.pm

AFFILIATION
    This file has no functionality, but instead is a placeholder for a loose
    collection of Perl::Critic policies. All of those policies will have an
    "Affiliation" section announcing their participation in this grouping.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a collection of Perl::Critic policies that are not included in
    the Perl::Critic core for a variety of reasons:

    * Experimental
        Some policies need some time to work out their kinks, test
        usability, or gauge community interest. A subset of these will end
        up in the core Perl::Critic someday.

    * Requires special dependencies
        For example, some policies require development versions of PPI (or
        some other CPAN module). These will likely end up in the
        Perl::Critic core when their dependencies are fulfilled.

    * Peripheral to Perl
        For example, the `Editor::RequireEmacsFileVariables' policy is
        metacode. These are not part of Perl::Critic's mission.

    * Special purpose
        For example, policies like `CodeLayout::RequireASCII' designed to
        scratch itches not felt by most of the community. These will always
        remain in a Perl::Critic supplement instead of in the core.

    All of these policies have the theme `more' so they can be turned off as
    a group via .perlcriticrc by adding this line:

      theme = not more

    The special purpose ones may be part of the `notrecommended' theme.
    Avoid these via:

      theme = not notrecommended

    Sorry about the double-negative... See Perl::Critic for details on how
    to interact with themes.
